    Privacy Policy for Scooter Trick Generator Android App with AdMob

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to your use of the Scooter Trick Generator mobile application ("App"). The App is developed and maintained by me, ("I," "me," or "my").

Information Collected

The Scooter Trick Generator App collects two types of information:

    Non-Personal Information: This information does not identify you as an individual. It may include:
        Device information (model, operating system, etc.)
        Usage data (time spent in app, features used, categories of tricks generated)
        Non-identifiable location data (country, region, not precise location)

    Information Collected by Third Parties: AdMob, a third-party advertising service integrated into the App, may collect certain information about your device and app usage to serve you targeted ads. This information may include:
        Advertising ID (a unique identifier for your device for advertising purposes)
        Non-identifiable device information
        App usage data (e.g., how often you use the trick generator, types of tricks generated)

Use of Information

I use the non-personal information I collect to:

    Improve the App and user experience (e.g., identify bugs, understand which trick categories are most popular)
    Analyze usage trends (e.g., how long users typically spend on the app)
    Provide technical support (e.g., troubleshoot issues)

AdMob uses the information it collects to serve you relevant and personalized ads within the Scooter Trick Generator App. You can learn more about AdMob's privacy practices here: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en.

Security

I take reasonable steps to protect the information I collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These steps include using secure servers and implementing appropriate security measures. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure.


Changes to This Policy

I may update this Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy on the App.

Additional Information

I am committed to protecting your privacy and providing a fun and informative experience for scooter riders of all levels. This Policy is intended to inform you about the information I collect through the Scooter Trick Generator App, how I use it, and the choices you have. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Please note: This is a policy is purely informative. It may need to be modified to reflect any future updates to the App or data collection practices.
